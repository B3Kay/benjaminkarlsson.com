## A Glimpse into My Story

2. 🏛️ Embarked on a 3-year Informatics journey at Umeå University.
3. ✈️ Wanderlust led me to spend a full 2 years traversing the globe, working as a Digital Nomad. I've called places like Poland, Spain, Portugal, and Indonesia my temporary homes.
4. 🚲 Beyond the digital realm, I craft tangible creations. One notable project involved handcrafting a towering bicycle, navigating the streets of Gothenburg adorned with snippets of national and local news, and radio broadcasts.
5. 🧑‍🏫 My passion extends to teaching; explore my Advent of Wisdom on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/benjimink_/reels/) or [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@benji.karlsson_/video/7314702498151927073).
6. 💪 Health and fitness are paramount; I delve into diets and training regimens. Presently, it's the carnivore diet coupled with calisthenics.
