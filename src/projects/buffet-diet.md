# Buffet Diet - Full stack Poject.

### Introduction
 
I've tried all kinds of diets: low-carb, keto, vegan, bodybuilder diets, and even carnivore. My main issue has always been that typical restaurants don‚Äôt cater well to these specific dietary needs. To get around this, I started going to buffets, where I could fulfill any dietary preference.

The only problem was finding them.

Buffets can be hard to locate, so I decided to solve this problem myself.

I began building a platform to help people find and review buffets nearby, tailored to their dietary needs. Google Maps and other platforms don‚Äôt adequately serve the dietary needs of modern lifestyles.

This is an opinionated page focused on finding reviewed buffets for specific diets.

Take a look at the [Buffet Diet - Github](https://github.com/B3Kay/next-buffet-diet-webb-app)
