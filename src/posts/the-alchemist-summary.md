üìñSuymmery + Notes

Content, summery, quotes and etc that are important.
Meaty part.

Personl Legend

The Alchemist has one big mayor theme going through it. The Personal Legend. Be brave, follow your dreams, go on a jurney, step in to the uknown dessert and find the treasure lying hidden within the Pyramids.

Follow your Dream.

We dont know why we exist, but everyone has a purpose. We just have to figure this part out. This is one of the big questions in life. But dosnt this also make our lives more purposefull, that you need to figure it out? Everyone has a purpose, just like the desert, the winds, the sun, the rain and all the people around you.

When we are children we always know. I remember, I was dreaming of bing a superhero or an astronaut. I even wrote it in a letter the my future self! When we are small we watch movies and we dream, then. Everything was possible.

With this book Paulo Cohelo is trying to show you that we can follow our dreams. If you do like the character in the Alchemist and starts to listen to your ohmen and never stop dreaming you will also find your treasure.

 "following your dream is like learning a foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in the end." - Paulo Cohelo

Leap of Faith
For us to follow our Personal Legends we need to take a leap of faith. This will start in the unknown, in the story Santiago goes in to the dessert, the dessert is filled with bandits, natural forces trying to kill you. This is a scary place, in the big dessert we are small. Once you are in the unknown there are no returns, but it's also here we will find our own treasure. In other words we need to be brave and try this new thing. Changing job is scary, the new future is unkown, will I find a job or not? But this is also where we are forced to learn, when we've quit and there is no return there is only one way forward, Towards our goal of finding that next job. The treasure always lies in the unkown, if it was easy, we woul have the treasure already and so many other peolple before us would already have found it.

This is always our choice. Most of the time, what we know is safe. We can most of the time go home. To be working in that store, for that boss. The known is safe, we know what to expect. But we have to choose our Identity, it is actually not given to us. We choose how to see ourself, which ultimately programs our future. You always choose to be the victim. If you get robbed of your valuables on a travel you can see it in two ways.
Either you are robbed and everything is fucked, you are now a victim. Or you can see it as "i'm an adventurer, looking for treasure" and this is expected to happen to such an adventurer. It's a part of the jurney. Every coin has two sides. Losses also gives possibillities. It could be loss of responsibillity, or being robed and loosing physical things. In my case, I lost my contract and it gave me the possibillity of travels and taking a sabbatical. I do not regret it. Everything good comes with something bad, and everything bad comes with something good. Now it's your time to do the best thing out of the situation.

Doing this, is your obligation, to yourself but also to the world. It will require great courage, sacrafice, you will have to take no regrets, no fear and to believe in your caus. People wont believe you.

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhen you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.‚Äù

- page. 159

When we cary the Elixir of Life or the Philosiphers stone it might sound to crazy to be true, that most people wont believe you. This part really resonated within me, and felt so exciting and empowering. It could be your new business idea och a revelation you are carrying. You should know there will be struggle.

Finding your personal Legend is in the end not about the treasure. I know it's such a clych√©, its not about the target but about the jurney. About the people we meet, the friendships we find, maybe love. All these memories and experiences. And they are all coming to realize your dream.

Self discovery
The jurney is in the end about self discovery. Paulo Cohelo calls it the mastery work, the perfection of self. This is where we can produce miracles. And just like in the book, not everyone can become an Alchemist. Because then gold wouild be useless, we also need bakers, carpenters, electricians, managers, engineers and what not. Everyone has differnt roles in this big puzzle. But it's about becoming the best version of you. What was impossible to previous you becomes possible. If you look back 10 years. Could you imagine then the things you are capable of doing today?
But there are two requirements, no fear of failure and no regrets.

Fear
Fear will always be the main obsticle to step across. Fear of dissapointment, fear of failure, suffering or that you actually arent deserving it. We fear mistakes, but this initsellf is a mistake, as we also learn from them. We need to live our mistakes and sometimes it could be the best thing ever.

‚Ä¢ "I‚Äôm afraid that if my dream is realized, I‚Äôll have no reason to go on living."

We carry a lot of expectations from other people, what our parents expect from us, our friends, family, or partner. That we should have ben a lawyer instead of an artist

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúIn the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends.‚Äù

- Coelho, Paulo. The Alchemist (p. 32). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition.

What happens it that with time, you will start to protect yourself from the suffering of not following your dream. The older we get the more we will rationlize why we didnt try, why we didnt do it when we had the chance. Our head will convince us to forget and drams are now impossible to realize. This will make us beome bitter like the Crystal Merchant in the book. You stop liking change och everything will one day become just a distant dream.

Follow your heart
Paulo Cohelo and The Alchemist preaches about followoing you'r hearth. I think this not always true, the book is very optimistic, but we cannot dismiss that all people also carry dark sides withing them and it's up to us to chose what thoughts and emotions to act on. This is where i disagreee a little bit with the Author. We need to follow our brain, as it can distinguish good and bad. Not only follow your hearth.

But how do you know you are following your heart?

According to Paulo Cohelo you know it, when it' feels right. Following your hearth takes you out from the suffering, it gives us the energy to to unimaginable things, like walking across the dessert, or climb a mountain. But most important of all it takes us to the presence. If we live in the moment, we will be positvly suprised by the good things. And this is important. This is where all things happens, your life is right now. Not yesterday, not tomorrow. If we would know what happnens in the future, it wouldnt be any suprises anymore. The positive suprises wouldnt exist and the bad suprises would just agonize and torment you to the end of your days. Do you really want to know what day you die? What disiese you will get the 24th of january 2055? Instead by being in the moment we can be happy, because emotions and feelings are only in the present, right now. There are beauty everywhere around us. Do like the tribesmen, when it's time for eatind dates. Eeat dates. When you are marching concentrate on marching and dont worry about the fight. We can die any other day

Power of Love
The character in the book meets the love of his life, but it's a little bit of a tragical romance. I wont go in to details but there are a few learnings we can take away from that.
If it is true love, we need to remember that something that is true, will allways be true.
 "Tru matter never spoil"
Love is an enabler of dreams. Love makes us want to b better, and allows us to take responsibillity in other peopls Personal Legends. Remember that we as other people are in your life, we are part of someone else personal legends. If it is true love, unconditional, then the love will never hinder you towards your true goal. Then you can do anything, turn yourself into the wind.
There need no be for a reason to exist for your love. You are loved because you are loved, this is unconditional love, and the universe conspired you to meet. When we meet someone and fall in love, we dream of a future with this person, and if there was no love, dreams would have no meaning.

Language of the world

Soul of the world
The soul of the world, is a little bit fluffy like all of the other concepts in this book. This book helps you see the world in a narritive, storylike and spiritual sense. But if the world had a soul. We could call it the Soul of the World. If we add some religious aspects to it, we can say that all things are one.

- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the principle that governs all things,‚Äù
- "all things are the manifestation of one thing only."

This is  very mysterious force, it's a positive force, it's very generous, it wants people to succeed and attracts life. This force is made of love and it will always progress, the world will always continue. Even though we leave this mortal realm. The earth will continue to rotate, creatures and process will continue to progress in the universe.

The soul of the world tries to communicate with us, to help guide us towards our destined path. If good or whoever creator had a goal for us, how could he nudge us without us witout pople noticing? I would say, by reading this book, it has given us 3 tools. Ohmens, luck and intuition.

üëÅÔ∏èIntuition
Intuition is knowing things of feeling things bout a direction that we cannot explain, we do not know why we have this feeling, it's just the way it is. Maybe you just have to do this thing because it feels right. This is intuition. It could b getting hunches that something is wrong. We are very good at feeling the atmosphere in a room when we enter one.

- The boy noted that there was a sense of fear in the air, even though no one said anything. Once again he was experiencing the language without words . . . the universal language.

Have you ever met someone and you are just sweped away buy there energy, passion and love for the things they do? Some people just have an overwhelming positive energy. And some people you just know they are going to accomplish great things. We can see when someone is following their personl legend. Anyone can see this, in their eyes, their moves, the way they talk about things. But intuition is just about finding secrets in the present. And this is what palm readers are experts at.

üçÄLuck & Coincidence
Have you've ever had beginners luck? This is a real thing right!? This is life wanting you to achieve your personal legend, you are getting a littl bit of a heads start, for you to taste the sweetness of sucess. This is called the Principle of favorabillity.

- "when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. SAID THE OLD KING"

üëÑOhmens
Ohmens are like god whispers, they are given to you. It could be that you see a sign, something you can feel inside that it's not just a coincidence. It's a message for you, and you can take this as an addvantage and shape your path. Ohmens are like a guidance to show you what is the right or wrong way to go. For example it could be that you are given an oppurtunity, it's is now or never. The feeling that it is time for something, maybe it's perfect timing for going on that adventure of yours?

  "Every blessing ignored becomes  curse"

But be ware, if you start ignoring thesse blessings from the world, you might accumulate negative energy and things will become harder to do. Your dream will be mor and mor of a distant dream.
Sometimes w are the ohmens in other peoples personal legend.

Alchemy
So what is alchemy, the book is named The Alchemist. Without spoiling you to much of the story, Ill tell you that alchemy is about transformation. Everythungs around you evolve. To not ending up bitter and miserable we need to embrace change and learn new things. Just as copper and gold has it roles. You have a role now, but will have another one in the future. The current you is different from the previous you.

- "If we serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to expand. And then I‚Äôll have to change my way of life.‚Äù

Don't be affraid of change. Embrace it and you will transform yourselves.
