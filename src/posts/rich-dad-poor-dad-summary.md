## 📖Summery + Notes

"Rich Dad Poor Dad" is an invaluable book that I highly recommend to entrepreneurs, young individuals, and anyone interested in unraveling the secrets of wealth accumulation. The book explores the mindsets of the rich, the habits of the poor and middle class, the importance of wealth in providing opportunities and security, and the tools and knowledge necessary for financial literacy.

I have structured the book into four categories:

 1. **Poor**, This section discusses the limiting mindset of the poor and middle class, where money controls them. It emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between assets and liabilities and debunks the illusion of job security.
 2. **Rich**, The rich have a fundamentally different mindset and focus. This section explores the habits and mindset of the wealthy.
 3. **Liberty**, Why wealth will make your life easier by allowing more opurtunities and safety. The 5 blockers of your financial success. But most important of all how to escape the rat race.
 4. **Financial Literacy**, is about basics of cashflow. What is a liabillity and asset, taxes and dept. What skills do you need to learn to succeed in becoming rich. How do you eaven defin rich? What is your financial statement?

### The poor work for money

The rich, those greedy bastards… The poor and the middle class have a limiting mindset of blamming others, of jelousy, fear of loosing and ignorance. Money is controlling them instead of being the ones controlling the money. They buy liabillities as cars and luxuries instead of assets. The biggest trap of the poor and middle class is the idea of job security which is just an illusion and short term solution and a ticket to the rat race.

#### 🚧Limiting believes

The poor and middle class are carrying limiting believes that are stopping them from taking action and calculated risk.

What are limiting believes:

- **👈👉Blames others**. But instead blames others for the responsibillity of their life, why their job sucks, for their low paycheck and hopes that someone else will fix their problems. They believe that the covernment will take care of them and support them with social wellfare when their working days are over.
- 🏎️**The poorpay much more effort and resources to look rich** . They are jeleous with a loosers mindset. Instead of trying to become rich, they want to look rich. Another problem is that they think the rich are crooks and evil and should pay more tax, or that they dont pay tax. They are jelous that someone else are making more money than them.
- 👻**Fear directs the poor** and the middle class to play it safe. We learn by early age not to take risky loans, being an entreprenour is risky, it's better to get a good education and a stable, secure job. They play it safe and they die boring instead of letting their passion direct them and conquer their fears.
- 😒**The poor and the middle class lack curiosity**, they dont learn new things and they dont move on.
- 🧐**Having a fast car does not make you rich** and it is very ignorant to think that money is the root of all evil. Many intellects of the middle class often think they are "above" sales people even though the sales person might make much more money. This is ignorant, who is actually doing the smarter choices?

#### 🤑Money controls the poor and the middle class

They work for money while still saying that they "are not interested in monmey" while still working 8h a day. This is straight up denial of truth. The middle class are slaves for money where they accumulate depts and digging them self deeper and deeper in to the rat race hole. The higher salary you have, the harder it will be for you to start a side hussle as missed work hours will be more and more valuable. They  are working for someone else, half of your salary goes to the government, a big piece to the employer, then to the bank on your morgage and lastly to them. They work hard but there is no accumilated wealth, the harder an employee work the more value he is created for their boss.

#### 🏠Buys liabillities

The poor and middle class are aquiring liabillities, these are things as luxy items as cars, tvs mobile phones, clothes, aswell ass things they think are assets as a home. They spend money instead of investing it. They most of the time spend everything they get, and with increased salary they increase their spending leaving nothing for investing in the future.

#### 🪤Job security, the biggest trap of them all

Imagine being an specialist forever. For the poor and the middle class job seBUqurity is everything. But the truth is that job securty only is a short term solution, where they will work hard to get little in return, a small pension and long term problems. If they quit working today, in how many weeks would you need to find another job? Speciality is a kind of slavery that will be harder and harder to escape, they become indoctrinated and this will be everything they are, working for someone else.

### The rich controls their destiny

What if you where in control of your life, you had the mindset to follow your dreams, the know how and the tools to  your personal success? The rich groom their children for success.

#### 🤯Start thinking big - Mindset

Imagine you had all the reseources to give have a substantial good impact on people. It could be anything from saving life to helping your best friend in business. The rich has a moral compass aiming them towards following their dreams and to work for learning. The path is the goal. If you work for learning insterad of for money it will benifit you in the long run. Choose teachers who have done what you want to do. But this will require emotional controll, just as when Robert in the book was working for his rich dad in exchange for learning how to become rich. But what is the purpose of all this richness if you are not making other peoples life better, rich dad said, "give and you shall recieve". Treat your business partners fair and well, your wife, and pay your workers well. They will help you make you more money.

The rich people have an ever curious mindset, they carry a sense of purpose and they believe that they have the power of their own destiny. Without the responsibillity over yourself you will not take any actions. You need a sense of purpose to be able to aim somewhere, to have the reason of waking up in the morning. But without the curiosity you will not look where nobody looked before. Robert says that two of the most important keys to your success is desire and braveness. You need the excitement of winning. Winners are inspired by loosing. Winners analyze and looser criticize. Don't follow the crowd, only dead fish follow the stream.

#### 🎮If I am the problem, I can do something about it. - Take controll

The rich focuses on the thing that they can control. Stop blamming those around you. You cannot control people around you. You need to realize that the only thing you can actually control is yourself. Start taking control of your feelings, become an observer and choose your thoughts. Dont react to your feelings. Todays society is focusing to much on the feelings. Listen to your head not your heart. When the emotions go up, the brain goes down. It's how you handle your emotions and experiences that matters. A glass can be half full or half empty. Choose to see the good things.

#### 🧠Your most valuable asset - Knowledge

This is why the rich focuses on learnig new things. The knowledge and wisdom the rich have is what makes money work for them. Every dollar holds power and they hire people smarter then them. They pay less tax and buys luxuries last. Learning is everything and it's your financial literacy that will help you buy assets and manage your money and the people working for you.

#### 📕Work on your weaknasses - learn

Learn to make money work for you. How to make every dollar you own in a money growing tree is not something you will learn in school. The school does not teach you how to master money, most of the time the teachers are laking real life experience. More then good grades are required to succeed in life. Instead the school teachers you to learn how to work for money. Get good grades and you will get a good job. People become what they study. The school does not produce entreprenours. To succeed in life you will need much more just braveness, dedication and grit. Not just study hard.  Life is the best teacher, but learning to make money is a lifetime project. But you need to start take control of your life, it requires guts and brilliance. Start learning the things you dont know.  Work on your weqaknesses because seeking discomfort is the primary basis of personal success. It is what we know that is our greatest asset, it's what we don't know that is our greatest risk. Your capacity to learn, relearn and apply what you've learn that is your most important skill.

### Liberty

Imagine you or someone you love got in to an life threatenig accident or sick from a curable disease and you knew that if only you had the money you could save that person. This could be the case even though you live in a country with social welfare programs. Hospitals will always have to priorize with governmental momey. The rich live a much easier life with less stress, fear, negative emotions and not a must to work. They have better healthcare, preventive care, better retirement education and power over their faith. Before I'll tell you how to escape the matrix, The Rat Race, I will share the 5 big blockers that are still keeping you poor:

#### 🗽 The 5 reasons you are still poor

 1. **😱Fear** - Be a Texan
The rich dad said "The situations you fear is the skill you need to learn the most." He wanted you to be a Texan. When they win, they win big and when they loose, it's spectacular! You need to learn to handle your life, you do not want to go broke over something lame. Instead be inspired by your loss to practice harder, study more and become better. Failure inspires winners while failure defeats loosers. To many people are so afraid of loosing they they already lost. They did not try. Bneing a winner means you are unafraid of loosing. Our biggest fear is rejection we just have to fail a lot and learn. Every rich person lost money. If you are afraid of risk, start early. Then you will get the compounding effect on interest on interest. Do mistakes early and learn.
 2. **💩Cynism** - Doubt is expensive
The biggest problem with cynics is that they focus on the bad stuff. This will shut of your brain of trying. If you want something, think how can I afford it? What if X? This will start the creativity in your brain. Cinics does not see mistakes as oppurtunities to learn. Unfortunatelly this is not encouraged in school, we are tought to avoid mistakes. This is what keeps people poor, they play it to safe. Instead, focus on the good stuff, most people are not born rich and worst times are where you can make the best investments. Winners analyze, cynics criticize.
 3. **😴Laziness** - The cure is Greed
One way the poor and the middle class are keeping themself poor is by being "busy". Doing other things then they need to do. Lazyness by being busy, to busy to take care of their own wealth. To busy watching TV, to busy ordering things online. There are a lot of ways the poor and middle class fool them selfe being busy by procrastinating with, shoping, hobbies, fishing, their kids or their work. "I have so much to do at work". The cure for lazyness is a little bit of greed. Greed is seen as something negative among the poor and middle class. "They think only about themself". But ask yourself, "how would your life be if you didnt need to work again?", the world evolve and progresses because we all want something better. The lazy mind has a lot of sneaky tricks up it's sleave: I'm tired, I worked really hard today or I cannot afford it. Rich dad forbid the words "I cannot afford it". It creates depression, helpnessness and shuts of your brain.
How can I afford it? Opens upp our minds for posssibillities, excitement and dreams. You know somewhere deep inside there is a spirit saying: "Let's go to the gym".
Action beats inaction.  
                     The lazy people will be victims to those who have self disipline.
The diciplined people will win over you. But remember that the hard road always becomes easier and the easy road becomes hard.
 4. **😎Arrogance** - Educate yourself
Be honest with yourself and other people around you. Arrogant people think they are the centre of the usniverse. Rich dad said: "What I know makes me money, what I don't know loses me money". Self esteem is something a lot of arrogant people lack, this is something you earn. The solution is to stop lying, to yourself and others. Say you dont know. And most important of all - Educate yourself.
 5. **🚬Bad Habits** - Our life is a reflection of our habits
We are not more then our habits. It's the action we take that will be seen. Habits are more important then education. To become rich you will need the habits of the rich. And habit number 1.
Only put money in the asset column.

#### 🍔Start minding your own business

What does Robert Kyasaki say is the plan to escape this slavery? First of all. Keep your expenses low, replace that Friday stake with a bowl of oatmeal porridge instead. Do not, I repeat. Do not go in to any large dept positions or you will be stuck in the rat race. You need to have free kapital, money to invest and start minding your own business. But what does that actually mean? Build a foundation, start educating your self. Take a class, or course in something you do not know. Learn how to make money work for you. What are assets you are interested in? What is your busines? If you are working a full time job, maybe it is stock investments. Can you start a side business? Can you increase your wealth by becomming better at what you do? Ordinary earned money by working for someone else is what is taxed the highest. Save up and build a portfolio and you will get a passive income. How about your pension? In a lot of countries the retirement age increases every year. Governments get more and more in depts and governmental pension has history to fail. Look at Greece, Italy and Sweeden. There  are no guarantees. Focus on selling and the delivery, you do not need to be best, just smart. Be like Mc Donalds, they best in the world at selling mediocre burgers. Focus on your business, not on your burger.

#### 💵Make money work for you

- 🏢**Build assets**
Make sure you have a solid base before you get maried, buy a house, have kids, take a risky financial position or get stuck in your job. You need to have money free for oppurtunities. You need free capital, therefore focus on your asset column.
- 🏭**Become a producrer,**
invent money. Intellegence solves problems. And problem solving produces value. Value can be converted to money.
- 🔨**Learn through life.**
Nothing worth having comes easy. All these things are learnt outside school. They are learnt in life. Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem? We need to make a lot of mistakes to progress.

### Finacnial Literacy - Finacial Knowledge

In order to beome rich we need to learn to become financial literate. To read and understand the language of money. How cash flow, accounting and management and other key skills for financial success. But how would you even define rich? Or even wealth? Rich dad talks about your financial statement. Your level of wealth. This is not your net worth, when you sell you will have to pay tax on your gains. But how many days, years or months can you go without having to work again? If you stop working today, in how many months or weeks  do you actually have to find a job? If you are at a point where your passive income is higher then your expanses, then you actually dont have to work again. You are now financially independent.

#### 💸Cashflow

According to Rich dad the most important financial skill is cashflow. Things you neead to learn are accounting, balance sheet, liabillities, assets, taxes and dept.

- **🧾Accounting & the Balance sheet**
The balance sheet is a very powerfull tool to understand your financial standing. It consists mainly of two component the assets and the liabillities. Focus on building the asset column and minimize the liabilitties column in the balance sheet.
- 🏠**Assets**
This is what the rich focuses. Money will work for you 24/7, imagine every dollar as an employee or as a money growing tree. Rich dad always recomended to buy assets he love. Assets you are naturally interested in. This way you will be more engaged and dig a deeper understanding. There are multiple categories of assets. A few are:
  ○ Business with no required presence
  ○ Stocks
  ○ Royalties from intelectual propert
  ○ Income generating real estate
  ○ Bonds
  ○ Notes (IOUs)
  ○ Anything else with value.
- **🏎️Liabillities**
Takes money from your pocket. Try to accumulate as little liabillities as possible. The poor pay them first, while the rich pay himself first. When assets genereate enough income to cover your luxuries. Then it's time to buy them.
- **🪙Taxes** - The government & Corporations
 The government will always try to take as much money as it can if you let it. Therefore it is very important for you to know the tax rules. If you now your right you dont need to be afraid. Everyone is always afraid of the tax man. Fight back! Th problm with the government is that it will always need more money. As the government grows it also need to increase taxes. The more money the government have, the more they need to spend. The more the spend the bigger budget they get next year without creating any kind of value. This unfortunately creates a pack of lazy thieves. According to rich dad the government are lazy workers trying to live of people who create real value. Instead they try to invent ways of using others money. The government have invented multiple different ways of making you pay more tax then you realize. You pay not just income tax on your labour. But the employee pays employee tax for every employee, social security or medicare tax, value added tax on goods and then you pay in some countries property tax. In the country Sweden that has the highest marginal tax in the world, the avarage swede works 9 months for the government and only 3 months for themself. They have a marginal tax of 75%. Of every 100sek 75 goes to the government.
But the rich always find a ways to pay less tax. And now we will get in to the secret of the rich. Corporations, a way of legally evade personal responsibillity and create a shared ownage. Corporations are just a folder of legal documents creating a new legal entity. The difference between a corporation and the government is that the less people hired, the less expenses the company have and the more money the rich make. Through this the rich pay less tax, minimze risk and can use tax advantages. With a corporation yuo pay less tax on dividend but can also pay expenses on before taxed money. With proper tax planning you can pay computer, phone, health club as company expenses. And you can do board meetings and conferenses abroad in exotic places like hawaii and combine it with your vacation.
- ✅**Good dept** - There are good depts and bad depts. Good dept are a mortage on real estate, business loan or educational loan.
- 🛑**Bad dept** - Credit loan, loan for luxuries or high interest short term loans.

#### 👨‍💼Management

The most important management skills you need to learn are, the managament of risk, systems and people. But not just any people, good people and good staff. The second which is one of the hardest things to find. If you are a good leader you will get a good troop, you don't want to be shot in the back. If you surround yourself with good people make sure to pau them well. Pay your accountant, your broker and everyone helping you well, as they are there to help you make more money.  We become like the pople we surround oursself with.

#### 📚Salees - Become a best selling author, not best writing author

The 3 most underrated skills as an entreprenour are sales, marketing and communication. Sales is like dating, you have to talk to a lot of people to get a good deal. Learn to get over the fear of rejection as this is the biggest trap. Rich dad recomends taking a sales job or sales class and all your communication will improve. Make a lot of offers and use an escape clause where you need approval of a business partner. Just dont tell them it's your cat. Be the best selling author, not the best writing. Be best at sales. For marketing you want to be controversial, it attracts attention. Good or bad, it's still attention. Learn communication skills as writing, speaking and negotiating.

#### 🍀Where are you right now in the Cashlow quadrant?

Robert Kayousaki developed the cashflow quadrant for you to realize part of the financial freedom you are in. It's usefull for you together with your fincancial statement to evaluate your career and your professional life. Each letter represent a type of worker you are.

- **E** - Employee💲
- **S** - Self Empliyed 💲💵
- **B** - Business Owner 🤑💵💵💵
- **I** - Investor 🤑💸💸💸💸💸💸💸
From left to right we got economical leverage, from working for money to money orking for you. And from top to bottom we got feedom, from your presence required to the income not being dependant on any active work. The optimal position is to be in the bottom right corner. Where you will generate a lot of money without doing anything, total freedom. As self employed you still have freedom but you are still required to make work hours to get payed, maybe you are a freelancing developer or a doctor. If you are a business owner your time is compounded by your employees but you are still required to be there and attend the business in one way or another. Example of business owener is running a store, a it company or a consultancy firm. Example of the investor only own the process but someone else is doing all the job for you, by owning shares, stocks, funds and royalties.

I hope you all enjoyed this book summary of Rich Dad Poor Dad. It's been a pleasure to write my first book summary for you. I read the book a second time and it's one of the first financial books I've read in my career towards financial freedom. I truly recomends it to all young and aspiring entreprenours and engaged responsible people out there.
Did it inspire you to adopt a growth mindset? What assets have you bought and liabillities sold beause of this book? How are you going to start investing in yourself?

Learning is everything.
