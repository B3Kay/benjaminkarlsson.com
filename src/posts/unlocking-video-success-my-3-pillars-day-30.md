# Unlocking Video Success : My 3 Keys - Day 30

**Day 30 - 30-Day Video Confidence Challenge - November 29, 2023**

> If you haven't been following my engaging 30-day video confidence challenge and are curious to learn more, dive into the why, what, and how of this transformative journey.

## Muchos Buenos

As I jot down these words, I find myself in my second month in Malaga, soaking in the vibrant atmosphere of southern Spain. Balancing my routines amidst the distractions of friends and travel has been a challenge, but here I am, having completed 29 days of videos. Originally, today was earmarked for a comprehensive overview of my learnings. However, as I crafted a mind map, I realized some topics are too vast to cover in one sitting.

**In brief, here's what I've learned:**

- 👄 Consistent pronunciation drills and voice warm-ups are game-changers.
- 🏦 Embrace frameworks, specifically the powerful 3 ACT structure for storytelling.
- 🌊 Authenticity coupled with knowledge is the alchemy for the perfect video.

Creating impactful videos isn't just about a message; it's about the how. Today, let's unravel the three vital lessons from my 30-day video confidence challenge.

The days flew by, filled with the joy of video creation. Now, the next chapter beckons—creating online content for the world to see. But before that, let me share the three pivotal insights I've gained:

**What we have at hand:**

- 🔥 Daily Warm-up and Pronunciation Practice.
- 📕 Storytelling & How to Structure Your Speech.
- 📹 My Workflow & What Truly Makes a Good Video.

Let's delve into it!

## 🔥 Daily Warm-up & Pronunciation Practice

Reviewing my videos, I noticed stumbling over words, tight jaw muscles, and difficulty in pronunciation. My mother's advice to speak more clearly wasn't enough. The revelation came during this challenge—I needed to exercise my mouth, jaw, cheek, and tongue muscles. Research led me to a 15-minute pronunciation and voice warm-up on YouTube, a simple routine that made a significant impact. What does the pronunciation warm-up do?

- 👅 Warms up your voice, navigating through different tones in a 3-dimensional space.
- ☺️ Turns challenging sounds into a workout, strengthening facial muscles for clearer speech and a confident smile.
- 🖼️ Tongue twisters and consecutive challenging words enhance speech fluency and speed.
- 🌪️ Acts as yoga for your mouth, energizing your brain, adding charm, and improving word formulation.

For those interested in a guided tongue morning yoga warm-up practice, please comment, and I'll create one for you! ☺️ This practice has readied me 100% for speaking in front of the camera.

## 📕 Storytelling & How to Structure Your Speech

Every challenge leads to stumbling blocks, and for video creation, it often involves making speeches more interesting and structured. Have you heard of "The Hero's Journey"? While it's a common story template, I'd like to introduce a simpler framework—the 3 ACT structure. This is how it unfolds:

### **The 3 ACT structure:**

- 🏰 **ACT 1 – Setup**
  - Introduce the story's who, where, and what.
  - Set the mood, describe the surroundings, and hint at the calm before the storm.
  - Confront the hero with a problem, leading to the main plot.

- 🐲 **ACT 2 – Confrontation**
  - Introduce the problem and delve into the bulk of the content.
  - The protagonist struggles, learns skills, and faces rising actions.
  - Transformation usually involves a mentor's guidance.

- ⚔️ **ACT 3 – Resolution**
  - Resolve the story and associated plots.
  - The climax answers the most critical questions, revealing the true nature of the characters.
  - Conclude with the resolution, ensuring a satisfying ending.

## 👍 My Workflow & What Truly Makes a Good Video

The essence of great videos lies in authenticity and continuous improvement through practice. The success stories of prominent YouTube creators revolve around these principles. Be yourself, have fun, and produce content that aligns with your values. Practice relentlessly—this constant improvement sets top YouTubers apart.

### 🌊 My Workflow

Suppose you aim to create a compelling video summary of a book. Preparation and planning are paramount. Instead of jumping directly into video creation, follow these 5 steps:

1. 👀 **Read.** Locate the material you wish to discuss, employing speed reading and note-taking.
2. 🦑 **Mindmap.** Organize collected content into mental models using a mind map.
3. ✒️ **Write.** Writing enhances thinking; it aids in formulating ideas and provides a 'pause' for reflection.
4. 🏰 **Memory Palace.** Use this powerful tool for remembering and organizing your speech topics.
5. 🤳 **Record.** Plan your video with a small notebook guide. Utilize the 3-bullet system or mnemonics for easy recall. Remember to incorporate an intro and outro, adhering to the principles of the 3 ACT structure!

That concludes today's insights.
