# From 40 wpm to 100 WPM in 22 days | How I became a typing ninja

## WHY?

Right, let‚Äôs get right in to it. The truth, I‚Äôm on the job hunt in 2024. The year when IT business is taking a slump. I‚Äôve been on a sabbatical for a year, I come back, thought jobs where going to throw themselves over me. I started applying for jobs since a few weeks back, got a few offers, but today I‚Äôm quite picky and wnat higher pay then what i‚Äôve been offered. Anyway this is just some background. What happened on one job, or actually twice is that I had to do a test to see my typing speed.

What the hell?

I never knew this was a thing. 2024 is so different. Why would anyone care about that isnt it about producing value for your customer that is the most important thing. That you write good code, not the speed you write shitty code? Because if you make a lot of mistakes, you are just producing more trash. Speed is not equivalent to value.

	Speed != Value

It shouldnt really matter how long it takes you for finishing a task, it‚Äôs more about finishing your task and doing it good. Creating value for your employer? If you do it in 2hours of 8hours. Does it matter if you are still delivering the same thing? This is not the subject of today. But it got me thinking.

Why would it matter? Let‚Äôs say I put myself in the shoes of a professional athlete or an employer who wants to employ a ‚Äú10x developer‚Äù whatever that is.
Ok if I‚Äôm a professional basket player, probably me or my coach would care about each mini individual detail. The way I hold the ball, the way I step. If you take your job extremely serious, probably you would think of each little detail that can improve your productivity aswell to be able to create more value. Think of it as practicing your footwork as a basketplayer, this is your interface with the sport. Ofcourse there are so many more things. This is the same with programming. You are hired to solve problems related to writing code. Hence the keyboard is your interface. To be come a faster and more precise basketplayer we need to make drills for our footwork. And actually it is the same for programming. If we can improve our accuracy and typing speed we can make less mistakes and potentially produce more value, potentially become more productive. Let‚Äôs say if you could write 2.5x times faster, you could write a A4 of text in 5 minutes instead of 12.5min. This is a huge improvement. What it also could be for your employer is a sigil that you take your jobb very seriously. It could mean that you are dedicated, and passionate about your craft. That you but extra time and effort in becoming more productive. In the end we have to llook at everything as a whole, just putting your fingers on a keyboard faster in itself is not making you a better programmer ofcourse.


## Stats

I did some research on typing faster, what are actually the statistics? Am I fats or slow, I thought I was probably a little bit faster than most people, but how do you know? first we need to do some test and figure this stuff out. So what are the average speeds? How fats does a good person type? Well here‚Äôs the stats:

Beginner: Less then 40wpm. (words per minutes) 
Avarage: 40-50wpm - 50th Percentile
Fast: 60-80wpm - 70-80th Percentile
professional - 80-90pwm - 90-98th Percentile

So if you studies a little bit of statistics in University of school you know about the percentile. We can assume, but also know that the spread of typing skills probably have something representing a bell curve.


Keybr.com

Let‚Äôs say your average speed is 59.1 wpm, then you are faster than 64.79% of all other people. Most people, the average are somewhere in the middle. If you are fast, then you type maybe 80wpm and you are faster then 80% of the population. If you type 90wpm you are faster then 98% of the population. 

I did my test, and I was slow‚Ä¶ Not extremely slow, but slow as a programmer. A programmer type a lot, and in average are 10wpm fastert.  My speed was 41wpm when I handed in to a job application. They didnt take me in for the job‚Ä¶ So, I‚Äôm right in the middle, the average, but slower then a average programmer. I thought I was fast though, and this totally hit my ego. The crazy thing is, most people and most programmers, they do not practice their typing speed. We kind of accepted that our speed was just the way it was. Nothing you could really practice, just like reading speed. I set out for a new challenge to increase my typing speed. And in this article, blog post, whatever I will tell you how I did it and surpassed the speed of 99% of people in a very short time.


## My Goal - The top 1%

I do not satisfy with the mediocre. I‚Äôm a competitive person and could do anything to achieve a job. So when I set goals, I set them high. My current best speed is around 41wpm with less than 90% accuracy. I will get in to why accuracy matters immensely later in the blog. 

What is a fast typing speed? To me something that would sound impressive, if 98% of the people write less then 90wpm i have to bet that. But I want to be in the top 1%. That means beating all 99% of the population. So I set a simple goal, that stood out. 100 Words per minute. In what timeframe, let‚Äôs set SMART(Read about it, if you want to know how to set smart goals) goals, within 30 days. 100wpm would mean 2.5x faster typing speed or 143.9 whooping percent increase. This also means a accuracy of 100%. This means I would write 500 words, an A4 page in 5 minutes, instead of 12.5 minutes, this is 7.5 minutes of time saving per page. If you want to work less and produce more in the same amount of time. This is actually a hack to do that. Potentially I could 2.5x my productivity. Oh my god. When you look at the math it is so simple. How long time did it take me to achieve this? What was my strategy and what do I recommend to anyone who want to do the same thing as me? I will give you all these secrets, just keep up with me. The truth is, I achieved this result in only 22 days practicing between only 10-30minutes per day. If you are bored and want to jump right in to my tips increasing your typing speed faster than I did, because I will give away all these tips to you for free. So you dont have to make the same mistakes as I did and not having to do the research I did. If you want to jump right in to the 3 main takeaways, go to the end of the blog: ‚Äúthree main takeaways‚Äù. I‚Äôm also providing you the 3 more bonuses in the end containing the tricks you need to step over that, 98th percentile mark, type 100wpm and be in the top 1% of typists.

## Who is this for?

This is for people like me around the 30-40wpm mark that are already working on their computer, like a programmer or a student who is already accustomed to typing without looking at their fingers and want to increase their typing speed to become the fastest typers in the top 1%. There are already courses outthere that you can buy, Udemy provide courses to learn touchtyping for 40$ dollars. I think this is incredible expensive, they also only expect you a achieve speed of 40wpm. Using the tips and tricks in this article you will be able to surpass 100wpm within 30 days, and this is totally for free, nothing charged then your attention, a little bit of your time and your trust. Imagine, I could easily charge +150 dollar to make you type 100wpm and be in the top 1% typist speed. Shall we jump right into it?

## How did I do it?

Again, if you want to know how I did it, and not just how I recommend to do it, stick with me. But if you just want to know the key takeaways and how to type 100wpm the fastest and not learning about all my mistakes, just skip this part and jump directly to ‚Äúthree main takeaways‚Äù. But if you want to know my exact story of how I achieved 100wpm in 22 days starting at 41wpm, then keep on reading.

### Week 1 - Just do it
Let us start from the beginning. Honestly, I did not have to much of a plan in the beginning. But I tried to create some kind of strategy, what did I do? Well, I researched the web, social media, looking at youtube, reddit and blogs. There werent to many answers. A lot of people show their typing on a fanzy keyboard or they are total keyboard geeks knowing everything about switches, bot nothing actually telling me exactly how I can become a better typist and go from 40wpm to 100wpm in less than 30 days. There where no obvious ways. The only thing I found out was people was using fancy tools and practicing daily. So I did what I do the best, just went for it.

What was my plan?
1. On startup everyday
2. When opening the browser, (Set monkeytype.com as my default website on startup)
3. Practice 10-30min

This actually worked. In 1 week I increased my average wpm to about 61.42wpm. Oh shit, these are huge gainz, but then, I came upon a platou. And in week 2 I found a solution to the problem.

### Week 2. - Accuracy
I was trying to type faster and faster evry day. Really trying the hardest I could, and guess what happened? The faster I went the more mistakes I did and the worse my wpm was. Why? I was typing more letters, but still my speed goes down? What the hell. The solution is quite simple though, and if you like maths, the answer is easy. If I type 3 letters that are wrong, I need to press backspace 3 times to go back to where we were before, this is now 6 key strokes. Now we are back from before the mistakes and now we type the 3 correct letters. This is totally 9 letters to write 3 correct ones. Which means 3 times slower for making a mistake. Also it for writing the word cow, the animal saying ‚Äúmuuu‚Äù. You could have 2 of the letters in the right position, but the word is still wrong. Let‚Äôs say you wrote ‚Äúvow‚Äù. You still have to go back and correct your mistake, wasting so much time. But what is more devastating is that you are breaking your flow. It just feels bad and put you off from the flow of thinking, cutting you off your thought, cutting of the sentence and you have to restart. And just like a car, we first need to accelerate to get upp to our speed. The same is with our typing. 

As I noticed this, I started focusing on accuracy, sure it was slower in the beginning, but overall I started making small incremental increases in speed again. I would say overall this is the number one most important thing for typing faster, accuracy, not making mistakes. During this week I also tried another tool, called typeracer. Where the faster you type, the faster your racecar travels over the display and the first one to finish the text wins the race. If you are competitive this might be for you, but to me the UI was distracting and I just wanted to increase my typing without the stress, that just causes you to make more mistakes.

### Week 3 - Thumbs
Ofcourse I plateaued again at around 70wpm week 2. I was wondering why I cant type any faster, and I started looking at my fingers. What am I doing? What could I be doing wrong? I‚Äôm using all my fingers for typing, I‚Äôm not looking down at they keyboard while typing, I‚Äôm touch typing. So I went to try other tools then monkeytype for learning typing. I tried a few and one that really got stuck to me is keybr.com. It had a virtual keyboard  and it was showing with a hand which finger you are supposed to use for each letter, and I realize I was using my left thumb for the lower rows, z,x,c,v,b. This is not the most optimal approach and requires your hand to play twister in order to reach all the keys. I was completing, should I relearn my typing habits to use the fingers instead? I was talking with a colleague in my coworking space about it. What if it‚Äôs not any faster, and I‚Äôm really wasting my time to learn a habit that is less efficient. Anyway after a little bit of contemplating I went for it, stop using the thumbs, only for space now on.

As I started, my speed lowered significantly, it was weird to relearn my pattern. When i pressed a key with my thumb, I had to take a stop. use my finger and continue again. After a while i started to gain speed again. But there is a specific training feature that keybr.com provide that  one very contributing factor for surpassing my platou.

#### Keybr.com
What keybr does that I culdnt find in any other tool, is that they provide you with the combination of letters that is the most important for you to learn right now. First you have to put some time for it to calibrate your typing and figuring out your slowest and mostly mistaken keys. Then it adapt the training for you to practice the hardest keys, the bottlenecks.

It also had a few other features that are useful. I was using keybr mostly for bettering my hard letter combinations and then monkeytype for pure speed and speed testing, as the UI is more minimalistic and good statistics overview. What do keybr do great? First of all, by default it‚Äô¬®s configured to introduce one new letter when it thinks you are ready, when you achieved your desired speed with the first letters. It also shows the desired finger placements and it produces nonsense words that are very similar to english writing patterns, I will get into more of this in the next week. This week I managed to get to 85 wpm, and I was hungry for more.

### Week 4 - So fast my wrists cramp!!

From the previous week I understood that I just need to focus on my weaknesses, my hard to type letters, like q,z,x,c, and v and I will drastically increase my typing speed. I did this and I improved, quite soon I was at +90wpm mark. I was now at a moment where I started typing so fast that my wrists/under arm muscles started getting cramps or fatigue like writing with a pen in school. This was definitely mind blowing, I almost thought it was going to be impossible to reach 100wpm and now I was so close. I was typing and typing, slowly climbing. 

Eminem released a new album this summer, and I never had any time to listen to it. I was typing nonsense words and I was a little bit bored. I put on the song and started listening to the rap. Normally when I work I try to put on ambient music not to distract myself. I listened through the whole album while practicing on keybr. And then I realize that something happened. WTF? I‚Äôm actually typing the words on the screen without reading them I felt like. It‚Äôs kind of like reading a text without subvocolazing,  and this is a way for you to also read faster. By not saying the words loud in your head, not ‚Äúthinking‚Äù the words loud that you see. So by listening to music I was focusing on listening to Eminem instead of words I see. The crazy thing is that I still saw the words and letters and wrote them. This became a turning point for me.

There is another great thing with keybr that works in synergy with what I just talked about, the removal of subvocalizing. Is that keybr generates words that look like english but they actually does not exist. Combinations of english word patterns but are totally new words. This forced me to type the characters that I see instead of the characters that are trained in to the pattern of a word. English is not my first language so I make a lot of mistakes. When I think of a word in english and then want to type it I sometimes spell it wrong, and usually the same word the wrong way. Because I have a habit or a pattern or a bad learning of how to type a word. The good thing with typing nonsense words is that you have to type the letters that you see and not the words. Which means you become faster att noticing the letters in the words and not just the word. Sounds a little bit flimsy but this is the case. So i continued to listen to Eminem while typing and then suddenly one afternoon the 23rd of september 2024 I go in to monkeytype in the end of my working day and go for a test. There it is, BANG 100wpm. I couldnt really believe it, I was just at day 22 when it happened. I felt great, and finally I can lean back and pride myself in the glory of my achievement.

## 3 key takeaways

So what are the most important 3 things. If you dont have time to read the whole article, just start here. 

This is the tldr, the 80/20 of it al.

### 1. Practice makes perfect
Touch typing and typing on a keyboard is a muscle memory. Essentially you want to push the button without thinking about it. And there is no other way of gaining this skill then to just do it. Practice day in and day out. Look at a kung fu master, they are drilling the basics every year from time to time. The main mistake why most people are only in the 40wpm area is because they actually never took their time to increase their touch typing skills and typing speed. Its actually pretty easy to achieve 100wpm, I just did in 22 days going from 41wpm. a 143.9% increase.

And how do you actually do this?

You put aside time and schedule your training, just like going to the gym. I do it the first thing when opening the browser, get it over with and then focus on more important tasks.

Keywords: muscle memry, fingerplacement, schedule, set aside time.


### 2. Accuracy before speed

Accuracy is almost even more important, I cannot say what is the most important of these two. It depends.  But if you are working on the wrong thing, typing the wrong letters or making mistakes this takes extra time and breaks your flow. Every 1 letter wrong requires 2 extra key strokes. Prioritize accuracy.

### 3. The Training Dojo

If the take martial art as an example. Just like fighting in the real world, fighting in the training hall, the dojo is different. We are practicing drills, practicing small details that has an impact on us in the real worlds. But in the dojo we can stop, separate, and look at a specific detail and master that before we go on to the next one. This is the same in touchtype practice. We go to the training ground, practice a specific pattern, and then go in to the real world and try to use it. In the dojo, we have specific tools for training, soft mattresses to not hurt ourself and exercices to practice a specific pattern in isolation. This is what we got the typing tools like keybr and monkeytype for. They let you practice specific parts of the typing experience in isolation in a controlled manner, and specifically practice on our weaknesses.

## Bonus

Probably you think, Hey Benji! This is it? This is all you are going to tell me? Yes, honestly it is that simple but I will give you three bonuses that will take your 70wpm to 100wpm and be in the top 1% of typist. You can easily reach +70 wpm with ‚ÄúJust do it‚Äù, nut if you want to go faster, listen up!

### Finger Placement

After the three main takeaways, this is comes right after. Use all your fingers when typing, this you should kind of know already if you are reading this post. Because you can probably type. But if you dont. But your left point finger on f, the rest of the left hand follows a long with d,s ,a. Then your right index finger on j, fuck you finger on k, then next on l  and so on in the same row.  You should notice that your keyboard probably got some indentation or bump for you to feel this without looking. Then try  try to go up and down with your fingers to. Use Keybr or any other online tool to learn the correct finger placement.
Extra hint, sometimes people use their thumbs for the bottom row. Dont do that,the fingers are faster and your thumbs have to travel a longer distance. I did this mistake, switched to using the fingers for zxcvbnm, and i am now much faster.

### Weaknesses

Work on your weaknesses. Ofcourse kinda makes sense, a chain is not stronger then their weakest link right? But what does it mean in typing? Practice the letters that are the hardest for you. The letters where you make the most mistakes or are slow. Keybr.com is a great tool for this.
Nonsense Words

By practicing on words that are nonsense words and not real world forces you to type what you see instead of typing what you thinking you see. If you ever taken art classes this is the same thing as drawing someone or an object, look more at your subject then at your painting. What are you actually typing?

### No Subvocalising

When typing, try to type without subvocolizing. WTF? This does not make sense. Well if you want to type fast we want to type what we see and not what we think, If you think your word at the same time there is a risk you might think the wrong word. it‚Äôs also an extra step, to pass before you can put the letters on the keyboard. How can you do this? Listen to music with lyrics while typing. Listen to something fun with a beat and you can dig along, like Eminem, justin bieber, lady gaga or whatever. As long as you dont subvocolize while typing. This would also increase your reading speed when you are reading.


### Good luck

So this is how I increased my typing speed to 100wpm from 41 wpm in 22 days wich is 8 days less then my goal. If you just follow these few tips and with a little bit of practice everyday you should be at 100wpm in no time. And dont compare yourself with my results, it might go faster, it might go slower. It depends on your previous experience, if you‚Äôve played an instrument or what else. The fine motor skills of your fingers and hands matter a lot. Just make sure you have a good posture, takes breaks and not sit stil for to long. Eat well, sleep, exercice. If you are overall healthy and have an healthy approach to learning I believe anyone can learn anything. I learned 1000 words of german in 26 days (Link) by studying 1 hour per day. I thought that was impossible to. But with the right strategy, mindset and a little bit of commitment, anything is possible.

Sheers

Have fun & stay health
