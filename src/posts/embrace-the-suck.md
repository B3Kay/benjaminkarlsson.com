# Embrace the suck - Become a hero

Where I live it rains almost everyday in winter. And I go biking to work or friends and so on anyway. No matter how hard it rains, I ride my bike anyway, through snow or mud...

But why do I do this?

Why not be comfortable and take public transport?

There are multiple reasons for me personally like health and mental clarity after movement.

But today, I want to dive into something deeper, how embracing the suck makes you tough. It’s all about mindset.

Sure it sounds macho, but what the hell. This is for people that resonate with growth and if this is you, follow along.

The other day I was biking home from work and the sky was pissing cats and dogs. As I’m going uphill on a big bridge crossing the river the rain is hurting my face like needles flying at me and the wind is trying to throw me off the road.

First I say to myself, fucking hell…

And then I scream out loud, FUCK YEAHHHH!!

I’m invincible.

That’s what I felt like, crazy I know. Just a normal day biking home from the office and I’m a freaking superhero. It was the feeling of being on an adventure rushing through my body.

I pushed through, and surprisingly, I was enjoying it—the cold, the pain. Because I knew that 99% of people would stay inside when the weather got tough. I realized that if I could face the wind and storms, doing things others avoid would make everything else feel easier.

And this is why I think you should go out and do uncomfortable stuff too, as it expands our comfort zone. Rain doesn’t kill you, are you made of sugar? Just dress up and go out there. Out in the rain and the wind. That’s where heroes go, to places where nobody else dares. It’s not about avoiding discomfort but embracing it. Dress up and face the storm, conquer your challanges.  When you come back inside, warmed by your victory, you know you’ve grown stronger.

Small wins everyday. That’s how you make the ordinary extraordinary.



What’s one uncomfortable thing you conquered today? 

Go out there and embrace the suck, be the hero of your own story!
