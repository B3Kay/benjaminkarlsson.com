# Embrace the suck - Become a hero

I try to have this mentality that if something is hard itâ€™s good for me. And if we push ourselves and do hard stuff, other less hard stuff will look easy and everything will become easier.
 
Where I live it rains almost everyday in winter. And I go biking to work or friends and so on anyway. No matter how hard it rains, I ride my bike anyway, through snow or mud..
 
But why do I do this?
 
Why not be comfortable and take public transport?
 
There are multiple reasons for me personally like health and mental clarity after movement.
 
But today, I want to dive into something deeper, how embracing the suck makes you tough. Itâ€™s all about mindset.
 
Sure it sounds macho, but what the hell. This is for people that resonate with growth and if this is you, follow along.
 
The other day I was biking home from work and the sky was pissing cats and dogs. As Iâ€™m going uphill on a big bridge crossing the river the rain is hurting my face like needles flying at me and the wind is trying to throw me off the road.
 
First I say to myself, fucking hellâ€¦
 
And then I scream out loud, FUCK YEAHHHH!!
 
> Iâ€™m invincible.
 
Thatâ€™s what I felt like, crazy I know. Just a normal day biking home from the office and Iâ€™m a freaking superhero. It was the feeling of being on an adventure rushing through my body.
 
I got power to push through and I was enjoying it, the cold and the pain. BecauseI know most people 99% of the population that stay inside at those kinds of moments. And I thought if Iâ€™m pushing through wind and storms, something that most people wonâ€™t do will make everything else people wonâ€™t do easy for me.
 
And this is why I think you should go out and do uncomfortable stuff too, as it expands our comfort zone. Rain doesnâ€™t kill you, are you made of sugar? Just dress up and go out there. Out in the rain and the wind. Thatâ€™s where heroes go, to places where nobody else dares. Itâ€™s not about avoiding discomfort but embracing it. Dress up and face the storm, conquer your challanges.  When you come back inside, warmed by your victory, you know youâ€™ve grown stronger.
 
Small wins everyday. Thatâ€™s how you make the ordinary extraordinary.


Whatâ€™s one uncomfortable thing you conquered today? 
Go out there and embrace the suck, be the hero of your own story!
